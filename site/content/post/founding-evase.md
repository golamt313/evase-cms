Today on the 12th of November 2020, during the global pandemic of **COVID-19**, Two young brilliant minds joined together and founded one of the biggest educational platforms online, Evase. <br></br>

Evase was founded by CEO Rasib Helal and CEO and Co-founder Golam Tahsin. The two founders of Evase established during this interview, that they had an existing friendship for near a decade, through similar hobbies that they loved and during their friendship up until this point and onwards, they would play a variety of games, do business online with new small projects and become online merchants, reselling goods and providing services.  They've additionally mentioned vaguely about a few self created projects they would both work on, on one of the worlds most renowned games, Minecraft.

> Rasib Helal:  It was quite early where technology like computers and mobiles were just introduced to Windows XP and touch screen or Internet, the world started to advance quickly in the depths of technology.
